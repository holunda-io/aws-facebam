# What just happened

* Zeebe Broker does not know workers
* Workers do not use Zeebe-API
* Only Orchestrator is connected to Broker
* Camel routes connect everything

# What we could do

* replace file system with messaging infrastructure
* any camel supported route will work out of the box
* Test routes by mocking components
