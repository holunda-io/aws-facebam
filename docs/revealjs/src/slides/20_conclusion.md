# Conclusion

# What just happened

* Zeebe Broker knows nothing about process and workers
* Orchestrator is connected to Broker
* Workers register via JSON
* Jobs are published to endpoint of workers choice

# What we could do

* replace file system with messaging infrastructure
* any camel supported route will work out of the box
* Test routes by mocking components
