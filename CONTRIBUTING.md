# Contributing


This project relies on two projects that are not yet finally published:

* https://github.com/zeebe-io/spring-zeebe
* https://github.com/holunda-io/camel-zeebe

its best to clone those projects and build/publish to the local maven repo.


spring-zeebe: `mvn clean install`
camel-zeebe: `gradle clean build publishToMavenLocal`
